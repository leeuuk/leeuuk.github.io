## Short Bio

I am an incoming PhD student in electrical engineering at Stanford University, and currently a research assistant at the National Cancer Center Korea.

Previously, I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Ewha Womans University, where I was advised by Prof. Jang-Hwan Choi. I was also a visiting student researcher at Stanford, advised by Prof. Adam Wang.

I am supported by a graduate study-abroad scholarship from the SBS Foundation and an EDGE Fellowship from Stanford University.
