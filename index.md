## Short Bio

I am an incoming PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University and currently a research assistant at the National Cancer Center Korea. My research interests broadly lie in machine learning, representation learning, and their applications to medical imaging.

I completed my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at Ewha Womans University, advised by Prof. Jang-Hwan Choi. I also spent time as a visiting student researcher at Stanford University, working with Prof. Adam Wang. During my master’s, I developed learning-based methods for evaluating medical image quality and built the first open-source dataset and challenge for this task. While at Stanford, I also worked on organ-level CT noise estimation by modeling the spatial distribution of image noise.

My PhD research is supported by a graduate study-abroad scholarship from the SBS Foundation and an EDGE Fellowship from Stanford University.
